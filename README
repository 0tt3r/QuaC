QuaC (Quantum in C) is a parallel time dependent open quantum systems solver, written by Matthew Otten (mjo98@cornell.edu). QuaC utilizes PETSc (www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc) for parallelization and linear algebra and features are still regularly being added.
QuaC strives to make the process of translating the physics equations into parallel code as simple as possible.
Sparse documentation can be found in the doc folder, including a rough user manual. The code is also heavily commented; many questions might be answered by looking through the source.
